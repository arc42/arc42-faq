## A General questions

{#q-A-1}
#### Question A-1: What does the _42_ mean?
"42" is a quotation from the science-fiction novel
[_Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)
by the famous [Douglas Adams](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/03/douglas-adams-42-hitchhiker).

In his book the number _42_ is the "answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything" - calculated by a _very_ big computer over a _very very_ long time.

Software developers like to use 42 as _magic_ number, that's a number
without any real significance, which you could replace by any other number.
Of course the name _arc42_ wouldn't sound half as cool if we had choosen
another number.

#### Question A-2: What's the license?

#### Question A-3: What's the pricing model of arc42?

arc42 is completely free to use (and will remain so!), for
arbitrary kinds of system, even in commercial context.

{#q-A-4}
#### Question A-4: How widely is arc42 used?
In the D.A.CH. region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), arc42 is used
by many organizations and corporations in various industries. We don't
know any statistically relevant numbers, though...

In these countries, alternatives like Simon Browns' [SA4D/C4]() model
are not well-established.

In the international scene, we guess that arc42 is way behind [SA4D].

The template is available in English and Spanish, further translations
are most welcome.

#### Question A-5: What's the target audience of architecture documentation?

**Short answer**

: (Potentially) all stakeholders of a system, that require information
about the architecture, e.g. the internal structure, crosscutting concepts
or fundamental decisions.

**Longer answer**

: Which persons or roles are interested in what parts of the architecture
depends on the specific context. Some typical targets for such documentation:

* Software developers who actually implement within the system.
* Software developers of neighbour systems, who need to know about
external interfaces and/or their technical details.

#### Question A-6: What are possible alternatives to arc42?

<t.b.d.>

{#q-A-7}
#### Question A-7: For what kinds of systems is arc42 applicable?
**Short answer**

: Due to its flexibility concerning tools, processes and extend, arc42
is well-suited for all kinds of IT-systems (small to large, simple to complex,
  all kinds of implementation technologies).

**Longer answer**

: For highly-critical systems, (e.g. safety-critical systems, where health
or life are at stake), you need to seriously consider documentation requirements.
We recommend to a-priori evaluate arc42, and enhance it according to your
specific needs in such cases.
Let domain experts or appropriate auditors review the resulting documentation
structure.

For all other _normal_ systems you can apply arc42: Depending on risk,
complexity, scope or size you should assess both the arc42 structure
and your toolchain for fitness regarding your specific purpose.

We successfully worked with dozens of clients in small, medium and
large organizations on many different systems with arc42 - and it never
let us down :-)
