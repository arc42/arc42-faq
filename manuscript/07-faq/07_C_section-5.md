{#q-C-5-1}
#### Question C-5-1: What is a "building block"?

<t.b.d.>

{#q-C-5-2}
#### Question C-5-2: Do third-party libraries, frameworks or tools count among building blocks?

**Short answer**

: Limit building blocks to _things_ you implement or maintain yourself.

**Longer answer**

: Some external software (like middleware, database, UI-toolkit or similar)
might be essential to understanding the structure of your system. You can
include those in the building block view.

  You definitely should show those elements in the deployment view
  (arc42-section 7)!.
