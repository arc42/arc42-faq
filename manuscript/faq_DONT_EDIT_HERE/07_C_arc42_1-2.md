## C Questions on arc42 sections


### 1. Requirements, quality-goals, stakeholder

{#q-C-1-1}
#### Question C-1-1: How extensive shall I describe the requirements of the system?

So that readers of your (architecture) documentation can understand
why the system exists and what its major requirements are.

* Briefly explain the major (max 3-5) use-cases, features or functions.
* Document the top 3-5 quality requirements by showing scenarios (see [question C-10-2 (quality scenarios)](#q-C-10-2)).
* Make sure the most important domain terms are commonly understood
among the development team (arc42 provides a glossary section for that purpose,
  but you better let your product owner or other stakeholders create and maintain
  those definitions.)
* Link to additional requirements documentation, if it exists.


{#q-C-1-2}
#### Question C-1-2: What are quality goals (aka quality attributes)?

See also questions:

* [C-10-2 (quality scenarios)](#q-C-10-2))
* [C-10-3 (quality tree)](#q-C-10-3))

We use the term _quality goals_ synonym to _architecture goal_:

A quality attribute that the system needs to achieve. These goals often have _long term character_ in contrast to (short term) project goals.

Software quality in general is the degree to which a system possesses the
desired combination of _attributes_ (see: software quality).

  Important quality attributes are performance, robustness, security, safety,
  flexibility, dependability, maintainability etc..

  It's helpful to distinguish between

   * _runtime quality attributes_ (which can be observed at execution time of the system),
   * non-runtime quality attributes_ (which cannot be observed as the system executes) and
   * business quality attributes (cost, schedule, marketability, appropriateness for organization)

Examples of runtime quality attributes are functionality, performance, security, availability, usability and interoperability.

Examples of non-runtime quality attributes are modifiability, portability, reusability, testability.  

It sometimes helps to take a look at the (very generic) ISO-25010
_software product quality_ tree, which summarizes most practically relevant
_potential_ quality goals on the abstraction level of "quality attributes
(see below)

{#q-C-1-3}
#### Question C-1-3: Why does arc42 propose a stakeholder table?

1. System stakeholders are potential consumers of information about the software or system architecture.
2. Several of the stakeholders might impose quality requirements on the system, that the development team needs to know about.
3. Architecture stakeholders are sometimes _forgotten_ during conventional requirements analysis, e.g. dev-teams of external interfaces, auditors
or developers themselves - these people or organizations will not have
requirements concerning the system itself, but its architecture or
architecture documentation.
4. Stakeholders are the most important source for any kind of feedback
that can help you and the development team to evolve and improve the architecture...  

{#q-C-1-4}
#### Question C-1-4: What shall be included in a stakeholder table?

**Bold** information should be present, the other parts are optional.

{width=90%}
|Information   |Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
|**Name/Role** | who or which part of an organization has an interest in the system or its architecture? Sometimes you name specific people, quite often you'll stick to roles |
|--------------|---------|
|Knowledge |What do these stakeholders know about the system or its  associated processes?
|--------------|---------|
|**Expected deliverables** |What do these stakeholders expect from the architecture or its documentation? Please don't confuse this with the _system requirements_. See [question C-1-5 (deliverables)](#q-C-1-5) below. |
|--------------|---------|
|_Relevance_ (priority)  | This is critical information: Some stakeholders will relevant or required for production acceptance or sign-off - but: Explicitly stating relevance or priority might frustrate, irritate or even instigate those with lower priorities... You need to consider the _political_ consequences of putting this information in your documentation - but the team should definitely know about stakeholders' relevance.  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Contact** |As trivial as a phone number or email address, so you or the team can contact this stakeholder. |
|--------------|---------|
|Comment |Any other information people might need concerning this stakeholder. |


{#q-C-1-5}
#### Question C-1-5: What are the _expected deliverables_ in the stakeholder table?

What documents, artifacts, deliverables, reports or other means of
communication do stakeholders expect or require from the architecture
or development team?

Please don't confuse this with the _system requirements_.

Some examples might clarify the term:

* Developers of the `fooBar`external interface might expect
a detailed description with sample data and code snippets,
so they know how to implement this interface (explained
  in the building block view, arc42 section 5).
* All developers need to know how the system stores cost-relevant
`furps`data into our auto-replicated NoSQL datastore (most likely
  explained in on of the crosscutting concepts in arc42 section 8)  
* The product owner calls for a _decision log_ of architecturally relevant decisions (arc42 section 9).
* Operation or administration need to know technical detail
of the required database and middleware configuration.


### 2. Constraints

{#q-C-2-1}
#### Question C-2-1: What are constraints?

Constraints restrict your freedom in decisions,
concerning the system or any associated processes.

Such constraints are often imposed by organizations across several IT systems.

Examples:

* System has to be operated by data-center XYZ, as our company has
a long-term contract with them.
* Part of software/hardware development has to be off-shored to our Asian subdivision.
* Our operational database system needs to be IBM DB2.

Please consider also questions [C-2-2](#q-C-2-2), [C-2-3](#q-C-2-2) and [C-2-4](#q-C-2-2).

{#q-C-2-2}
#### Question C-2-2: What types of constraints exist?

Three major types of constraints exist:

* Organizational constraints: E.g. compliance to (standard) processes, budget, time, required information flows, required (management) reporting structures, adherence to certain documentation templates or conventions...
* Technical constraints: Usage of specific hardware, middleware, software-components, adherence
to specific technical or architectural decisions (e.g. use of specific frameworks or libraries)
* Conventions, e.g. programming style, naming conventions or similar stuff.


{#q-C-2-3}
#### Question C-2-3: What kind of constraints shall I document?

At first - try to avoid documentation of constraints, as somebody else might
already have documented them. Refer or link to existing documentation.

Document the constraints that:

* shape or shaped important architectural or technical decisions,
* help people to better understand your architecture


{#q-C-2-4}
#### Question C-2-4: Can/shall we negotiate constraints?

Should some constraints prove to be especially unfavorable, risky or even expensive
for your system, you should definitely try to negotiate them.

An example: Let's say the company-wide constraint is: "Our software has to be developed in Java".
One of your tasks is the development of a specific smart-card reader, including
the appropriate hardware device driver - you should convince your management that such software
is better written in either C, Forth or Lua.
