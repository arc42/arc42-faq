<t.b.d.>


{#q-J-3}
#### Question J-3: Is there a checklist for arc42 documentation?

<t.b.d.>


{#q-J-4}
#### Question J-4: Is there a general checklist for architecture documentation?

<t.b.d.>


{#q-J-5}
#### Question J-5: How can I create delta-documentation with arc42?

In other words: How can I document the changes (deltas) between two consecutive versions of a system?

<t.b.d.>


{#q-J-6}
#### Question J-6: What level of access permissions shall stakeholders have on the architecture documentation?

**Short answer**

: Keep the administrative effort as low as possible: If you
accord details access permissions, you create administrative overhead.

**Longer answer**

: Usually, all stakeholders can read and write the documentation. Some cases justify exceptions from this rule:

  * For large teams, you should modularize your documentation
  and restrict write-access to certain parts, to avoid
  _accidental_ changes.
  * You might differentiate (short-term) _project_
  and (long-term) _system_ documentation. Everybody can
  write in project documentation, only few people might modify
  system documentation.
  * In case of regulated documentation, you might need
  detailed permissions (and access logs) to avoid manipulation.
