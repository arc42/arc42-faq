## B Questions on methodology


{#q-B-1}
#### Question B-1: Which parts of arc42 are "essential", which are "optional"?

**Short answer**

: Please don't _fill in everything_. Document **only what your stakeholders need**.

**Longer answer**

: <t.b.d>

{#q-B-2}
#### Question B-2: Does arc42 prescribe or enforce specific notations?

No, arc42 works completely (!!) independent of notation or syntax.

{#q-B-3}
#### Question B-3: Shall I use UML for arc42 documentation?

You don't need to - but:

UML notation is well-supported by various (free and commercial) tools,
has a clear semantic and is pretty much standardized - therefore we
(Peter + Gernot) like it.

On the other hand, UML does not guarantee any positive effects for your
architecture or your team. Other notations might work as good (or bad) as UML.

You need to ensure that all stakeholders have a mutual understanding of
your notation. That can become really difficult, if you draw only boxes
and lines - as those have no semantic at all (at least without further explanation)

People tend to interpret such symbols in a way they like - most likely
different than the original author intented...

See [question D-4](#q-D-4).

{#q-B-4}
#### Question B-4: What is the minimal amount of an arc42 documentation?

{#q-B-5}
#### Question B-5: Where to document external interfaces?

<t.b.d>

{#q-B-6}
#### Question B-6: How to document external interfaces?

<t.b.d>

{#q-B-7}
#### Question B-7: Where to put links to external systems ("neighbours")?

<t.b.d>

{#q-B-8}
#### Question B-8: Where shall I describe important (blackbox) components?

<t.b.d>

{#q-B-9}
#### Question B-9: Can I use arc42 in agile projects, e.g. with Scrum?

Yes, of course. See [section E](#section-vii-E)

{#q-B-10}
#### Question B-10: Can I update documentation incrementally? Or shall I document after the implementation is finished?

<t.b.d>


{#q-B-11}
#### Question B-11: What kind of information shall I provide for which stakeholder?

You need to inquire with your specific stakeholders, we can only
give you rough approximations from our experience... that will
most likely miss the goals of people involved in or with your system.

Show them examples what you _could_ deliver with low effort. Incoporate
their feedback. See [#tip-iii-3](appropriateness).
