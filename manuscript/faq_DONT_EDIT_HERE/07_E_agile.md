## E Questions on arc42 and agile methods

The Agile Manifesto says: "Working software over comprehensive documentation". It does **not** say "no documentation".  

{#q-E-1}
#### Question E-1: Does arc42 work with Scrum, Kanban or other lean/agile approaches?

Yes, it surely does. arc42 is supposed to be used "on demand" - you provide only the type or amount of information required for your specific documentation purpose.

This interpretation fits nicely with lean and agile approaches - where you shall avoid _waste_ and focus on fulfilling requirements... arc42 helps you to fulfill your documentation requirements easily in a pre-structured and well-thought-out way.


{#q-E-2}
#### Question E-2: Shall our team make arc42 part of the definition of done (DoD)?

Yes, of course: If documentation is not part of the DoD, then it surely won't be done.

Remember: arc42 proposes lean, economical and compact documentation that can be incrementally or iteratively enhanced.

{#q-E-3}
#### Question E-3: How can arc42 help us in reducing documentation effort?

* Document crosscutting concepts instead of too many building blocks.
* Use abstractions in the building block view and runtime view.


{#q-E-4}
#### Question E-4: We use Scrum. How can we integrate arc42 into our sprints?

Documentation shall be part of your Definition-of-Done. Therefore arc42 is _automatically_ included in Scrum processes.

{#q-E-5}
#### Question E-5: In agile projects, what kind of information shall we write down and what shall we communicate orally?

Imagine you're a future stakeholder who then needs to work on the system (implement, architect, deploy, test, operate, monitor or other). Then ask yourself what information you need to have...

{#q-E-6}
#### Question E-6: In agile projects, can we skip (defer) documentation for a while and focus only on implementing?

In theory, yes. In practice such a deferral means that this documentation will never ever be created - and stakeholders might need to dig deep into source code to gather the appropriate information.

We urge you - document economically (short, brief, compact), but do this continously.

{#q-E-7}
#### Question E-7: What are the most important tips for documentation in agile projects?

* Even in a Scrum-team, appoint a person responsible for documentation. We like to call her/him the "The Docu-Gardener", whos' tasks shall be:
    1. care for the adequate form and content and
    2. proactively search for unnecessary or outdated parts and remove them.
  Please note: care does not mean your gardener shall create all content by her- or himself, but identify appropriate producers within the team or among associated stakeholders.
* Document economically (“Less is often more”):  We really believe that documentation can be helpful and ease development work - but only in an extend and degree appropriate for the system and its stakeholders.
* Clarify appropriateness and needs through early feedback: The type of your documentation should be appropiate with respect to the system, the affected people, domain, risks, criticality, effort/cost and possibly even other factors.
* Focus on explanation and rationale, not only facts: Most facts about a software system can be found in its source code - but not their explanation, reasoning and rationale.
* Rate requirements higher than principles.
