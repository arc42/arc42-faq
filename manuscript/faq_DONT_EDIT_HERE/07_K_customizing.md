## K Questions on customizing arc42

{#q-K-1}
#### Question K-1: Are we allowed to customize arc42 for our (company/organization/system...) purpose?

Yes, of course. See [Question A-2 (arc42 License)](#q-A-2).

You may modify the structure of the template, re-create it in any tool of
your choice or even rename it for your own purpose
(one of our clients called it SAT42, what we really enjoyed.)

To be fair, you should reference Gernot Starke and Peter Hruschka
as creators of arc42 in case you use or modify the template...


{#q-K-2}
#### Question K-2: What kinds of customizations are common for arc42?

**Short answer**

: Customize or change arc42 only if you absolutely need to. The
standardized structure of arc42 has a high recall value - many people are
accustomed to it.

** Longer answer**

:Keep arc42 modifications to subsections and leave the high-level structure unchanged.

  I (Gernot) encountered the following modifications during real-world projects:

  * User-interface view (UI-design, UI-forms, common layout etc). Sometimes, UI details can be highly relevant for other architectural aspects, e.g. handling application state, integrating with workflow technology or similar.
  * Data view, explaining technical data models or concrete table structures. Often relevant in very _data-centric_ organisations, where portfolios of applications are built around these data structures.
  * Developer guide, containing detailed development information, sometimes called _development use cases_.
